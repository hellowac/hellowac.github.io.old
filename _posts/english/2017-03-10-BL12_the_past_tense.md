## BL 12 The Past Tense

过去时

There are two types of past tense verbs :

- __regular verbs__: add “ed” to the simple form
- __irregular verbs__: don’t add “ed”

regular verb simple | regular verb past | irregular verb simple | irregular verb past
-------|----- | ----- | --------
work | worked | be | was/were
live | lived | get | got
move | moved | go | went
walk | walked | put | put
open | opened | eat | ate
wait | waited | have | had

Regular verbs add `ed` to make the past tense (work/worked) and irregular verb change their form entirely (go/went),

or they don’t change at all (put/put).

The most important verb to learn first in the past tense is “be”.

__Be - Past Tense__

subject + (was/were)

__Singular__	|	__Plural__
--------------|-----------
I was | We were
You were | You were
He was |
She was | They were
It was |

- I was at school yesterday.
- We were in New York last week.
- It was cold this morning.

To make the negative , add "not".

__Single__ | __Plural__
-----------|------------
I was not | We were not
You were not | You were not
He was not |
She was not | They were not
It was not |

Most people use the contractions when making the verb “be” negative in past tense :

- was + not = wasn't
- were + not = weren't

It’s important to know the different between the _present tense_ and _past tense_ :

- I am here today. (present tense) -> the verb “be” is “am”
- I wasn’t here yesterday. (past tense, negative) -> the ver “be” is “was”
- I was here last week.(past tense) -> the verb “be” is “was”

Only the verb “be” changes its form for singular or plural.

All the other verbs, _regular_ and _irregular_ use one form in the past tense,

which makes this tense easy to use for making statements.

More practice with this important verbs comes in [Lesson 16](http://www.learnamericanenglishonline.com/Blue%20Level/B16%20Be%20Past%20Tense.html).

__Regular Verb : _Learn___

Subject + ____ed

Singular |	plural
---------|---------
I learned | We learned
You learned | You learned
He learned |
She learned | They learned
It learned |

Use the past tense for any time the comes before

now, yesterday, last week, last year, this morning,

or just a minute ago .

regular verbs :

when learning about the past tense in English ,

It’s important to know the different between the simple form of the verb and the past tense form of the verb :

learn is a regular verb and

- He learned a new song yesterday.
- She learned to grow tomatoes last summer.

When making the negative of question in the past tense,

you just have to add verb “did” before the simple form,

and it make the question in negative  :

- “What __did__ you __learn__ ?” the “did” is the helping verb(助动词) and the “learn” is the being verb (被动词)
- “They __didn’t learn__ anything .” the “didn’t learn” is negative .

To make the negative , use “__did__” + “__not__”(didn’t) + the _main verb_ in the simple form :

Singular | Plural
---------|--------
I did not learn | We did not learn
You did not learn | You did not learn
He did not learn |
She did not learn | They did not learn
It did not learn |

Irregular Verb: Have

Subject + _____  ( __irregular verbs__ take many different forms in the past tense)

__Singular__ | __Plural__
-------------|------------
I had | We had
You had	| You had
He had |
She had	| They had
It has |

Irregular verbs must be memorized because they change their form completely.

and commit them to memory.

### Review:

The Past Tense describes the things you did

yesterday, last year, back in February, in 1973, or an hour ago.

Regular verbs, such as learn, take an “ed” ending after the subject.

- work - - - worked,
- learn  - - - learned,
- visit - - - visited

Irregular verbs change their form entirely or not at all.

- eat - - - ate,
- go - - - went,
-  be - - - was/were,
- hit - - - hit,
- cut - - - cut

The form of the past tense is not dependent on the subject.

See the example below:

__regular verb__ - work :

I worked yesterday.

__Irregular verb__ - eat :

I ate breakfast earlier.

__regular verb__ - work :

You worked yesterday.

__Irregular verb__ - eat :
