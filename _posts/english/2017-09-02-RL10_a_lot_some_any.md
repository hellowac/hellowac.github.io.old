**A lot, some, and any are used with indefinite amounts:**

A: There are a lot. (This is a large number). Or.... <br/>
A: There are some students. (This is a small number but the number is not known.) Or.... <br/>
A: There aren't any students. (This is zero or a very, very small number and the number is not known.)

### Reading Time : Raccoons are common throughout North America.

**Vocabulary:** <br/>
**abandoned**: people were in a location, but then they left it. <br/>
**hollow**: empty <br/>
**tasty**: delicious <br/>
**lid**: cover; top <br/>

Raccoons are common `throughout` North America.
They live in `urban`, `rural`, and `suburban areas`.
They make their homes in old, hollow trees, or they live inside `burrows`, which are `holes` `dug` into the ground.
Sometimes they try to make themselves at home in `abandoned` buildings,
and they might even try to get inside your house when it's cold during the winter.

Raccoons are very `intelligent` animals.
They're good at finding food, and they `adapt` well to their environment.
They know that when people put `garbage` outside of their homes, there's probably some tasty food inside the garbage `cans`.
In areas populated by both raccoons and people,
it's a good idea to have a trash can that has a strong lid* and doesn't tip over.
These fury little creatures are very determined to feed themselves and their families.

Raccoons are cute as babies.
In fact, some people try to keep them as pets.
But when they get older, they can become quite large and very `destructive`.
That's one reason why it's not a good idea to keep a raccoon as a pet.

Raccoons are `nocturnal` animals.
That means they are most active at night.
The mother raccoon travels with her babies as they go out looking for food.
Unfortunately, they sometimes walk onto highways where they are hit by cars and trucks.
It's very common to see dead raccoons by the side of the road if you do a lot of `traveling` on highways in the United States.
