### Reading Time : Luke and Sandra are going to have a baby.

Luke and Sandra are going to have a baby.
Sandra is seven months pregnant,
so they expect the baby will come in the middle of May.
They are both excited and a little nervous about becoming parents for the first time.

When the baby comes,
Sandra is going to take a six-month leave of absence from her job.
She wants to spend a lot of time with her new baby.
After that, she will go back to work, and then Luke will stay home with the baby.
Right now he's a student studying law,
but he'll be finished with law school by the end of this year.

To prepare for the baby's arrival,
Sandra's family and friends are having a baby `shower` for her.
This is her first baby,
so she needs a lot of things: a `crib`, a baby `carrier`, a high chair, baby clothes, baby `bottles`, and a lot of `diapers`.
