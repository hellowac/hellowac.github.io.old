### Reading Time : Matthew gets ready to go to work.

Matthew gets ready to go to work early every morning.
After he wakes up, he makes himself some coffee,
he reads the newspaper, `shaves` and showers, and he has breakfast.
This morning Matthew is running late,
so he only has enough time to `shave` before he leaves his `apartment`.

Matthew turns on the water.
The water from the `faucet` is cold,
so he lets the water run for a minute before `cupping` his hands together and `splashing` water on his face.
The warm water feels good on his skin,
and it helps him wake up a little.

He puts on the `shaving cream` and he begins to shave.
Matthew is careful when he `shaves` because he doesn't want to cut himself.
First he `shaves` under his `nose`,
then he `shaves` from the right side of his face to the left side of his face.

When he's finished `shaving`,
Matthew `rinses` his face with water to get the shaving cream off.
He `dries` his face off with a `towel`, gets `dressed`, and heads to work.
Once he `arrives` at work,
he'll get some coffee from the coffee shop near his office.
