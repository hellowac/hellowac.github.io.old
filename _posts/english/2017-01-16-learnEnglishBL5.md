# BL5 This/That  These/Those

this／that／these／those

* __This__
    * A thing or a person is `close`
    * This = singular
* __That__
    * A thing or a person is `far`
    * That = singular
* __These__
    * Things or people are `close`
    * These = plural
* __Those__
    * Things or people are `far`
    * Those = plural

## Example:
- __Close__ = x…y
1. This pencil in my hand is yellow.  (singular)
2. These pencils are not very sharp. (plural) 
- __Far__ = x……………………y
1. That car across the street is red. (singular)
2. Those cars in the parking lot are blue. (plural)

- __these/those__  __That/this __ 
1. Take these stairs to get to those buildings 
2. That blue building in the middle of this picture is very tall

“__That__” is often contracted with the singular form of the verb “be”
* That is a window. = That’s a window.
* That is my friend,Tom. = That’s my friend,Tom.

| “__That’s__” usually sounds much better than to say, “_That is_”
| “__That__” can’t be contracted in the plural form: _That’re_(no!)


`This`, `these`, and `those` can’t take __contractions__
