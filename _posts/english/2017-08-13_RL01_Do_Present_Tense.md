The verb "`do`" can be used to make a `statement`:

`I do the laundry every weekend.`

... but it is usually used to make `the present tense` or `the past tense` negative.

`I don't have any money.`

`He didn't go to store yesterday.`

It's also used when making questions:

`Do you what time it is ?`

`Does he have a coat ?`

**Examples:**

- I wear glasses.
    - I `don't see` well without my glasses.
    - `Do` you `wear` glasses ?
- You speak English.
    - You `don't speak` Chinese.
    - `Do` you `speak` Vietnamese?
- He works on a computer at work.
    - He `doesn't work` outside.
    - `Does` he `like` his job ?
- She rides a bike to work.
    - She `doesn't have` a car.
    - `Does` she `wear` a helmet ?
        - Yes, she `does`.
- It looks ripe. (ripe = ready to eat.)
    - It `doesn't grow` in the winter in Minnesota.
    - `Does` it `grow` in the spring ?
        - Yes, It does.

    - We `don't live` in Canada.
    - `Do` we `like` Minnesota ?
        - Yes, we do .  or ...
        - Yes, we like Minnesota.

    - You `don't play` tennis.
    - Do you play football all year long ?
        - NO, We don't , We play in the fall.
- They walk their dogs every day.
    - They `don't take` their cats for a `walk`.
    - `Do` they `walk` their dogs on a leash.
        - Yes, they do.

The verb "do" is a very important verb.

We use it to make the present tense,
the present tense negative,
and for asking questions.

**Examples:**

`I do many things on the weekend.` (present tense, "do" is the main verb)

`He doesn't like to go to the store.` (present tense negative, "like" is the main verb)

`Do you want to see a movie?` (present tense question, "want" is the main verb)

"Do" is often used as a main verb, but only for **particular activities**,
such as housework, cleaning, studying, research, and shopping.

**Examples:**

`I do the dishes every night.` (do = wash)

`She does her grocery shopping at Cub.` (do = go/finish)

`They do their homework at the library.` (do = complete)

The past tense form of "do" is "did."

**Examples:**

`I did the dishes last night.`

`She did her grocery shopping at Cub.`

"Do" is also used for creating emphasis:

**Example:**

**A**: You don't like this very much.

**B**: No. I do like it!

### Reading Time : 阅读时间

He rides to and from work every day,
