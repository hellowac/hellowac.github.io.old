**would like = want**

The verb “would like” requires `an object`(宾语), `a gerund`(动名词), or `an infinitive`(动词不定式) after it :

- I `would like` a `bagel`. (The word “bagel” is an object.)
- He`’d like` a new `job`. (The word “job” is an object, Notice that the subject and “would” are contracted to form “He’d ”. This is very common.)
- They`’d like` a new `dog`. (The word “dog” is an object.)
- They`’d like` `to get` a new dog. (“to get” is an  infinitive.)

Most people make a `contraction` with the subject and “would.”  :

- I `would like` a  burrito = `I’d like` a burrito.
- She would like to make a call. = She’d like to make a call.

**Present Tense** -- negative

I wouldn’t like ___		 | We wouldn’t like ___
You wouldn’t like ___	 | You wouldn’t like ___
He wouldn’t like ___		 |
She wouldn’t like ___	 |	They wouldn’t like ___
It wouldn’t like ___ |

**Remember**: You must have an object after the verb “would like.”

You can also use a gerund after “would like.”

- You `wouldn’t like` living there. (“Living” is a  gerund.)
- He probably `wouldn’t like` the food.
- They `wouldn’t like` doing that kind of work. (“Doing” is a gerund.)

Note: Using “`would like`” in the negative is not always an easy thing to do.
This expresses an opinion about a person that might not be true.

He gets a five-dollar allowance every week.

He needed to buy a few other things for the fish.
He bought a small aquarium, some fish food, some `plastic rocks`(塑性岩石) and `plants`(植物), and a book about goldfish.
The total `bill`(账单) came to $36.09.
