Count Nouns Singular | Count Nouns Plural | Noncount Nouns <br/> (Don't use in plural form)
---------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------
car | cars | traffic
apple | apples | fruit
machine | machines | machinery
fact | facts | information
chair | chairs | furniture
dollar | dollars | money
minute | minutes | time
(Only use an article with these: a or the) | (These plural count nouns use "many") | (These use "much")

**It's important to understand the difference between noncount and count nouns when using many and much.**

**Noncount nouns are often used to describe large categories while count nouns are usually more specific.**

**Examples:**

- There is a car in the street. (singular count noun)
- Question: How many cars are in the street?
- Answer: There are a few cars in the street (plural count noun)

- Question: How much traffic is there?
- Answer: There is a lot of traffic. (noncount noun)

**Noncount nouns always use a singular verb.**

**Count nouns are singular or plural.**

**Much and Many are usually used with the negative:**

**Examples:**

- There `aren't many students` in the classroom. (perhaps 4 or 5 students)
- There `isn't much food` in the refrigerator. ( a small amount of food)

**Any + not, never, or without expresses zero:**

**Examples:**

- There `aren't any students` in the classroom (zero)
- There `isn't any food` in the refrigerator. It's empty.
- He went outside `without any shoes`. (There are no shoes on his feet.)
- They `never` want to eat `any vegetables` or drink `any milk`.

**Much and Many are usually not used in the affirmative:**

**Examples:**

- There are many apples in the basket. <em>It sounds better to say...</em>
- There are <u>a lot of</u> apples in the basket.
- There is much milk in the refrigerator. <em>It sounds better to say...</em>
- There is <u>a lot of</u> milk in the refrigerator.

### Reading Time : Skyscrapers are very tall buildings.

`Skyscrapers` are very tall buildings.
They are found in many large, American cities.
`Skyscrapers` in New York City and Chicago reach more than a 1000 feet into the sky (304.8 meters),
which is about the length of three football fields.
These huge structures are appropriately named "skyscrapers" because they are so tall that they seem to touch,
or "scrape" the sky and the clouds.
On a clear day, you can see a skyscraper from several miles away.

Early skyscrapers were built with iron, steel, and masonry;
modern skyscrapers are built with steel, concrete, and a lot of glass.
Skyscraper construction is popular in large cities nowadays because land is very valuable.
The only direction for the development of a large building in a busy downtown is up.
`Skyscrapers` help define a city's skyline,
and they help preserve land for parks and public plazas.

The Empire State Building (right photo) in New York has more than 100 floors.
It's a very famous building.
Tourists enjoy going to the observation deck near the top of the building.
From there, they have a good view of the city.
The Empire State Building was the tallest building in the city until the construction of the World Trade Center buildings in the 1970s.

The tallest skyscraper in the United States is the Sears Tower (renamed the Willis Tower in 2009) in Chicago, Illinois.
The tallest skyscraper in the world is in Dubai (the Burj Khalifa).
It stands at 2,717 feet (828 meters), which is about the length of eight-and-a-half football fields.
Other famous skyscrapers are Tapei 101 in Taipai, Taiwan, Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and the Jin Mao Tower in Shanghai, China.
