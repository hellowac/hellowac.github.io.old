## BL 10 Prepositions

__Articles 介词__

Prepositions show location, proximity, and relationships :

- He is standing on a pencil.
- She is at the beach.
- The flower is in the glass. 

**in / on / at :**

if somebody ask you a question : where do you live ?

you can answer in one of three different ways :

Use “in” for cities, states, and countries : “I live in Minneapolis.(city)”  or “I live in Minnesota.(state)” or “I live in the United States.(country)”

Use “on” with streets : “I live on Main Street.” you can’t use “in” or “at” in the street.

Use “at” when giving a __complete address__ : “I live at 2105 Main Street.” when giving the number and the name of street, you have to do use “at”

if somebody ask you a question : where do you work ?

Then you use the proposition “at” : “I work at ____(an name of the company)” -> “I work at Tony’s Pizzeria”

As same a question is “What do you do ?” your answer : “I work at ____(the name of the company)” or “I work in ___(there is an area of the work)”, example, 

- if you are a sale person, you can say “I work in sales”
- if you are a teacher, you can say “I work in education” or “I work at a school”
- if you are a doctor, you can say “I work in health care” or “I work at a hospital”

Where do you eat ?

- I eat at home.
- I eat in/at a restaurant.
- I eat at a table. (when you inside the home or inside the restaurant)
- I eat food on a plate. (The food is on the table and the food is on the plate.)

Prepositions are necessary to learn about. The most important to learn now are “in”, “at”, and “on”. Most prepositions have very specific applications as shown below :

- You can get `into` the house through this door.
- The cat is drinking `from` a bowl.
- There is food `on` the table.

**Another very common preposition is “to”.**

### From video :

The word “to” is often used when going from one place to another place.

“What time do you go `to` school ?” from home.

Sometimes the word “to” isn’t used with “home”.

“What time do you go home?” from school. It’s not necessary to use “to” with the word “home” .

"She needs _to go_ `to` the store."

Some students confuse the preposition “to” with the information of infinitive(to go) using “to”.

Proposition follow by a noun , this is a prepositional phrase -> preposition + noun = `prepositional phrase` (介词短语)

“She needs _to go_ `to` the store _to get_ something _to bring_ `to` the party.”

“She needs to go(infinitive) to(preposition) the store to get(infinitive) something to bring(infinitive) to(preposition) the party.”

“to the store” -> prepositional phrase ,

“to get” -> infinitive

“to bring” -> infinitive

“to ” -> preposition phrase.

“to the party” -> prepositional phrase

so the word “to” in this sentence five times, There are three _infinitives_ and two _prepositional phrase_.

Many Americans and the questions sentences with the word “to”, for example : “who do I give this to ?” , “To whom do I give this? (in British english)”

In these questions , you can choice to use “to” at the end or not use “to” :

- “Where are you going ?”
- “Where are you going to ?”
- “where is she Flying ?”
- “Where is she Flying to ?”

if you learning English carefully, you know the word “to” is often used with the verb “go” , for example :

“I have somewhere to go.” 

“to go” is infinitive , you can follow the preposition “to” -> “I have somewhere to go to”. 

in negative ,“I don’t have anywhere to go” -> “I don’t have anywhere go go to”.

Finally :

Don’t use the verb “to” preposition with the verb “too” , in this case : 

“I’m going to the party, Are you going too ?”, 

in here , “too” as same as “also”, too = also , It’s a different means

### continue:
