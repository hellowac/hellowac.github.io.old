## do - negative

**Present Tense**

singular | Plural
---------|-------
I do not = I don't | We do not = We don't
You do not = You don't | You do not = You don't
He does not = He doesn't |
She Does not = She doesn't | They do not  = They don't
It Does not = It doesn't |

The verb "do" is a helping verb.
Use "do" to make the present tense and the past tense negative.
The verb "do" is also a main verb.

[The video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05JqFOKE9DQ) explains the difference between a helping verb and a main verb.

**Examples in the present tense:**

- I don't work on the weekend. (present tense negative)
- He doesn't like to go to the store. (present tense negative)
- They don't have any money. (present tense negative)

**Examples in the past tense:**  The past tense form of "do" is "did". Did + not = didn't

- I didn't work last night.
- She didn't go shopping yesterday.
- We didn't see that movie yet...

**Be careful:** "Do" is also used as a main verb,
but only for particular activities,
such as housework, cleaning, studying, research, business, and shopping.

**Examples in the past tense:**

- I didn't do the dishes last night.
- She didn't do her grocery shopping at Cub.

Separating the contraction creates emphasis

**Examples:**

- I do not want to do the dishes.
- He does not have his license.
- Please, do not put that hot pan on the counter.

`Never put do + not + ____ing`

- He doesn't going to work.( incorrect )
- He doesn't go to work. ( correct )

Avoid bad American grammar!

- She don't go to work on Sunday.
- It don't matter to me.
- He don't know.

**Practice :**

Complete these sentences with the correct form of the verb "do."

- He `___` his homework at the library. (does)
- `___` you like to play football? (Do)
- Where `___` they live? (do)
- She `___` not want to eat that. (does)
- We `___` our laundry at the laundromat. (do)
- What `___` you do? (do)
- `___` it take long to get there? (Does)
- `___` he live near the school? (Does)
- I `___` not have any money. (do)
- The students `___` not have their books today. (do)

Complete these sentences with the helping verb "do" and the main verb to make the negative:

_Helping verb = do or does  + not_

_Main verb = live, shop, eat, go, see, etc._

- He `___` `___` in that house. (live) (doesn't live)
- Mary and John `___` `___` at that store any more. (shop) (don't shop)
- It `___` `___` long to get there on the bus. (take) (doesn't take)
- I `___` `___` any more coffee. (want) (don't want)
- You `___` `___` enough time to get to work. (have) (don't have)
- She `___` `___` any milk from the store. (need) (doesn't need)
- We `___` `___` dinner every night at home. (eat) (don't eat)
- The car `___` `___` . (work) (doesn't work)

### Reading Time : 阅读时间

Donna and Bill had lunch together yesterday.
They're both in the same Spanish class,
so after class was over,
they went out to eat at a restaurant.
Donna ordered a big plate of french fries and Bill ordered a hamburger.
They shared a milkshake.

Bill helps Donna with her Spanish.
He's a very good student,
and he learns new things very quickly.
He likes helping Donna because she's a very nice person,
and he hopes to go out with her more often.

Donna needs to spend more time studying,
but she works in the evenings and sometimes she doesn't have enough time to study.
She doesn't always understand the teacher because the teacher speaks entirely in Spanish and sometimes he speaks too quickly.
