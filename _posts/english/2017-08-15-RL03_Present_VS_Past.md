The verb "do" is a helping verb.
We add it to the simple form of a verb to make questions and negatives in the present tense and the past tense.

**Examples:**

- I `don't work` on the weekend. (present tense negative).
- I `didn't work` last weekend. (past tense negative)
- He `doesn't like` to go to the store. (present tense negative)
- He `didn't like` to go to the store when he was younger. (past tense negative).
- They `don't have` any money. (present tense negative)
- They `didn't have` any money last week. (past tense negative.)

**Note**: "Do" is also used as a main verb for activities, such as housework, cleaning, studying, research, business, and shopping.

**Examples:**

- I `don't do` the dishes every night.
- I `didn't do` the dishes last night.
- She `doesn't do` her grocery shopping at Cub.
- She `didn't do` her grocery shopping yesterday.
- They `do not do` their homework at the library.
- They `didn't do` their homework last night.
- Their company `doesn't do` business in Minnesota.
- They _never_ `did` business here.

The past tense form of "do" is "did."  Did + not = didn't

**Examples:**

- I didn't go to work yesterday.
- She didn't take the bus to work.

Separating the contraction creates emphasis.

**Examples:**

- I `did` _not_ `want` to do the dishes last night.
- I `do` _not_ `want` to do them now!
- He `does` _not_ `have` his license!
- He _never_ `did` get it!
- Please, `do` not `put` that hot pan on the counter!

Never put "did" + `___`ing together.

- He <s>did going</s>  to work last night. (incorrect)
- He went to work last night. ( correct )

Avoid bad American grammar!

- She <s>don't go</s> to work on Sunday. (She doesn't go to work on Sunday.)
- It <s>don't matter</s> to me. (It doesn't matter to me.)
- He <s>don't know</s>. (He doesn't know.)
