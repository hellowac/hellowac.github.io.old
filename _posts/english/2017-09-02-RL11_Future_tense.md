## The future tense

The Future Tense - Will <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>

singular | plural
-------  |  -----
I will -> I'll  |  We will -> We'll
You will -> You'll  |  You will -> You'll
He will -> He'll  |  
She will -> She'll  |  They will -> They'll
It will -> It'll  |  

**examples:**

- I'll go to class tomorrow and teach English. (I'll go = I will go)
- You'll go to class tomorrow and learn English.
- He'll go to a movie in the afternoon, and he'll eat a lot of popcorn.
- She'll come to class.
- It will probably snow this week. It'll probably snow this week.
- We'll both be in school tomorrow.
- You'll be there, too!
- They'll play in the snow after school is over.

**Another way to make the future tense is by using "(be) going to."**

I <em><strong><u>will see</u></strong></em> my friends on the weekend. <br/>
I <em><strong><u>am going to see</u></strong></em> my friends on the weekend.

The meaning is the same in both sentences, but the "going to" future is often `preferred` because it sounds a little more `relaxed` and `conversational`.

Practice the "going to" future in the next lesson.

**negatives:**

will + not = won't

**forming questions:**

Will .... ?

Will I drive ?

Will You drive ?

`helping verb ` + `subject` + `main verb`(simple form)

- Will you drive to the airport ?  Yes, I will /  No, I won't
- When will you drive to the airport ? Asking for information about time.
