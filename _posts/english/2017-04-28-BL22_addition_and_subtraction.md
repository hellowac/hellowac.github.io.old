## Addition and Subtraction ：算数加减

**addition or adding :**

five | `plus` | three | equals | eight
--|---|---|---|--
5 | + | 3 | = | 8
two | `and` | two | is | four
2 | + | 2 | = | 4

**Note**: Some English books will use the plural verb “equal” or “are” for the equal sign (=).
Grammatically, this is correct but most people use a singular verb.

**The teacher asks for the answer like this :**

- What’s two plus two ? (use the singular verb for “b” — “is”)
- 2 + 2 = 4 ( two plus two equals four )

**Subtraction or subtracting :**

five | `minus` | three | equals | two
-----|-------|-------|--------|------
5 | - | 3 | = | 2
ten | `take away` | seven | is | three
10 | - | 7 | = | 3

**Note**: The first example (using “minus”) is preferred over the second, but “take away” is popluar.

**The teacher asks for the answer like this :**

- What’s five minus three ?
- 5 - 3 = 2 (five minus three is two)

Of course, you know how to do math in your own language, but it’s important to practice in English.
Here are some other ways to talk about addition and subtraction :

**Addition :**

```
A:What do you get if you add six and eight together ?
B:You get 14.

A: If you put two and two together, what do you get ?
B: You get four.

A:If you add 20 to 30 , what does that make ?
B: That makes 50.

The word “makes” is often used when counting money.
```

**Subtraction:**

```
A: What do you get if you subtract five from nine ?
B: You get four.

A: How much do you have if you take three away from seven ?
B: You have four.
```

### Reading Time:  阅读时间

```
Mr.Jefferson is a math teacher.
He’s a good teacher.
but sometimes he’s very `strict`(严厉).
Some students really don’t like him or his class.
They say he’s mean.
Students have to sit in assigned seats, and no one can talk when he is talking.
If someone misbehaves, he gives out a detention.

Last week, Darnesha Brown got in trouble.
because she didn’t do her homework.
Mr. Jefferson called Darnesha’s parents to tell them what happened, and her parents grounded her for a week.
The next time Mr.Brown asked Darnesha for her homework, she had it.

A few days ago, a student threw a paper airplane across the room.
It hit Mr.Jefferson in the back of his head.
When he turned around, he was very angry.
He immediately found out who did it. It was Bobby Nelson.
Mr.Jefferson sent Bobby to the `principal’s office`(校长办公室).
He got into big trouble.
```
