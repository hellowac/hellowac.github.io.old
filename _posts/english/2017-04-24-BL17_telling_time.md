## Telling Time : 谈时间

Important  verbs for asking about and telling time : `have`, `know`, `be`, `tell`

- **Questions:** Do you `have` the time ?
- **Answers:** Sorry, `I’m not` wearing a watch.
- **Questions:** Do you `know` what time it is?
- **Answers:** Sure, it’s 6:00.
- **Questions:** What time `is` it?
- **Answers:**  5:50. (five fifty, ten minutes to six)
- **Questions:** Can you `tell` me what time it is, please ?
- **Answers:** It’s a quarter after two.

**The Question most often you asking about time is :**

- A: What  time is it ?
- B: It’s 2:00 (two o’clock)
- B: It’s 2:00 a.m
- B: It’s 2:00 p.m

**a.m** = after midnight / morning
**p.m** = afternoon /evening

**usually when telling time use “it’s…” then the time. :**

- “It’s 2:15 (two fifteen)”
- “It’s fifteen after two.”
- “It’s a quarter after two.”

**Each section of the clock is five minutes.**

- five after four (4:05)
- ten after four (4:10)
- fifteen after four = a quarter after four(4:15)
- four thirty = half-past four  (4:30)
- twenty five to five (4:35)
- forty five after four = a quarter to five (4:45)
- 4:55 - 5:00 range = It’s almost 5:00 = It’s about 5:00
- 4:55 - 5:05 range = It’s around 5:00

**Important vocabulary:**

- **o’clock** = :00 (7:00 = seven o’clock)
- **a quarter after** = 15 minutes after the hour (3:15 = It’s a quarter after three.)
- **a quarter past** = 15 minutes after the hour (3:15 = It’s a quarter past three.)
- **a quarter before** = 15 minutes before the hour (3:45 = It’s a quarter before four)
- **a quarter to** = 15 minutes after the hour (11:30 = It’s half past eleven)
- **half past** = 30 minutes after the hour (11:30 = it’s half past eleven)
- **thirty** = 30 minutes after the hour.(11:30 = It’s eleven thirty.)

The easiest way to tell someone the time is to use a digital format.

For example, when someone asks you what time it is, you can say, “It’s 5:30.” Instead of , “It’s half past five”

- “It’s 5:13.” = (five thirteen) or
- “Its 5:02.” ( five o two)
- or “It’s 5:50.” (five fifty)
- __ Note: __ 0 is pronounced “O” not “zero.”

**There’s difference between “day” and “date”**

**When someone asks you the date, it’s not necessary to give the year.** For example:

- What’s the date ? ——>  It’s June 6. (Not It's June 6, 2005)

Make sure you use [ordinal numbers](http://www.learnamericanenglishonline.com/Blue%20Level/B21_Numbers.html)  when you say the date.

You can listen to the way I say the date very day on [my blog](http://www.learnamericanenglishonline.com/BlogLAEO.html).

- When did you arrive in the U.S. ? ——> In 2002.
- When is the next election ? ——-> In November of 2010.
